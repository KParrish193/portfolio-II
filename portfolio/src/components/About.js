            <p>
            I am a highly design-oriented Fullstack Web Developer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS) currently seeking new opportunities in the western United States. I recently completed the Full Stack Web curriculum at Lambda School, and have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing with a Chemistry minor.</p>

            <p>
            Emphasizing positive user experiences in front-end web design is where I do my best work. I don't believe an app or website should be considered "done" until all users can have a great experience with it. Other experience includes a demonstrated history of customer service, attention to detail, and teamwork working in the retail industry.</p>

            I can be found mountain biking through the Uintas, climbing at the rock wall, on a calm lake paddleboarding with my pitbull, Tallahassee, cuddling my two cats, or hip checking my friends and foes at the Derby Depot in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
